In a real project you won't want to do all the work yourself, so let's take a look at how we can install a module to help us add icons to our projects.

# React Icons

- [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)

```sh
npm install react-icons --save
```

React icons gives you access to thousands of some of my favorite icon libraries like Font Awesome, Bootstrap Icons, and CSS.gg.... To get it installed, we're going to issue and npm install command.

# Importing an Icon

```jsx
import { ICONNAME } from "react-icons/LIBNAME";
...
<ICONNAME />
```

> >

Once you've installed the library, whenever you want to use an icon, you can easily import it into the component. I'm going to use one called box icons.

To use an icon. First you figure out which library you want, or you can just do a search for what you need. 

```jsx
import { BsFillBootstrapFill } from "react-icons/bs";

<h1 className="text-5xl"><BsFillBootstrapFill className="inline-block text-red-400 align-top" /> Pet List</h1>
```
