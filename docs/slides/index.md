I'm really honored to be speaking here and what I wanted to do today is to give you some practical advice that I wish I'd had known when I first started out.

# What we'll talk about

- Careerbuilding
- Negotiating Salary
- Mastering Social Media

> >

Most of what I wish I'd had know fall into three categories.

- Focus on Careerbuilding
- Negotiating Salary
- Mastering Social Media

First, I really wish someone would have told me how the mechanics of getting a job worked and that I need to focus on not just jobs, but also careers.

Second, nobody showed me how to negotiate a salary, and it isn't a subject that you hear discussed often.

The third one seems out of place here, but I wanted to give you some practical tips on mastering social media. It's a topic that I've been really working on in the past few years.

# Careerbuilding

> >

Let's get started with careerbuilding. So first, I want to explain the mechanics of how getting a job works. I published a couple of courses on Getting your First Job in Software Development, Developer Career Paths and about 70 other publications for Lynda and then LinkedIn learning.

I also wrote a book called Exploring Multimedia for designers and been a Public Speaker at a number of conferences in the US and Canad. So I plan to get to how that happened.

# Doing the right thing?

- Going to 'The Internet'
- To be: An Archeologist
- Don't worry about it

> >

When I was in high school at about the 10th grade, I decided that I needed to figure out what I was going to be when I grew up. So, I went to what we called the internet in those days, which was the library and I got a book how careers. Seemed like a good place to start.

I read the whole book, took the assesments and decided that the perfect career for me. Anyone can guess what I wanted to be? An archaeologist. I'm not sure if that was a horrible book, or perhaps I'd been watching too many movies at the time, but that seemed sensible. All I can say is I don't even like being outside in the sun.

You've probably thought about this yourself and my advice is don't let this stop you from focusing on something right now. According to the Washington Post. Only [27% of college graduates have a job related to their major](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/05/20/only-27-percent-of-college-grads-have-a-job-related-to-their-major/). I got a BA in Journalism and although I now have a masters in Computer Science, that was hardly where I was in high school or even in college.

# Focus on the Core

- Storytelling
- Studying
- Succeeding

> >

Some of my least favorite classes in high school and college ended up being some of the most important. Here's the three things that I think are important.

First is storytelling. So things that help you communicate your ideas better. English is my second language, so in high school I had to take about twice as much english as a regular student. Then I picked a BA in Journalism, which meant I had to take additional classes in Journalism Law, more writing, public speaking. I hated those classes, but they ended up being the most relevant to my current job. 

About 80% of what I do is writing and speaking. Things like public speaking just take a lot of practice. I've spoken in a room with hundreds of people, everyone gets nervous and the only way you stop getting nervous is by doing it more and more.

Another great thing I learned from college is studying. Granted, I was much better at this my second time around for my Masters. I remmeber I had a class where I had to read 5 major things...three chapters in different books and two research papers and summarize what I learned in four bullet points. That ability to read quickly, but take notes and summarize is invaluable. The Stress that you feel in school because you have too much homework and too many classes will prepare you for when you have a full plate at work.

The last item on my list is succeeding. When I went to school the first time, I didn't do so well. When I applied for my masters I was in probation the first semester because my grades weren't that good. But I was ready the second time and got a 3.95 GPA. I'm still sore about the two A minuses I got, but huge improvement. School is a great test for how you handle work. 

At some point in your career, you will figure out how to be successful and you can start now. Go for that A on every class. Learn how to set goals and achieve them. If you can do that in school, you can do it anywhere.

# Get a job

# The first job

- Getting Experience
- Networking
- Ignoring Failure

> >

Getting that firt job will be harder than any of the other jobs you're going to get. The problem is that most jobs ask you for some type of experience and since you haven't had a job, how do you GET that experience.

For some of the courses I did, I interviewed hiring managers from Facebook, LinkedIn and Recruiters and they all told me the same thing. Experience doesn't have to come from having a job in the field. You can build demonstrative experience if you have an internship or school projects that show that you can handle. The all told me that people underestimate the power that having a good intership can have towards getting that first job.

Lou Adler, one of our influencers and author of The Essential Guide for hiring did a survey and found that a whopping [85% of jobs are filled via networking](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/new-survey-reveals-85-all-jobs-filled-via-networking-lou-adler/). There is nothing you can do that will land you a job better than learning to network. Trust me, I checked with my interviews. It is much harder to land a job without it.

The last thing I have for you is to learn how to succeed. The problem with learning how to succeed is that it comes with a lot of failure. A good book you can read is Moneyball. It's the story of how Billy Beane, the Oakland Athletics changed baseball by focusing on a mathematical analysis of the game. But that wasn't my favorite part of the book.

You see before Billy Beane was a manager, he had been a baseball player who made it all the way to the big leagues, but only played a few times. In the book he talks about how the only difference between successful and unsuccessful players was how they handled failure. He said that he hated losing and if he had a bad turn at bat, he started playing worse and worse. But he noticed that great players would not let a bad performance affect them. They knew that it was a numbers game.

Applying for your first few jobs is a numbers game. A lot of hiring isn't about the specific knowledge, but about how you handle the interview, how well you communicate and present yourself. You will probably be bad at the first few interviews you take, so don't let them get you down and move on to more interviews.

# Job Searching

- Application
- Phone/Video Chat
- In-Person

> >

Let's talk about who actually getting a job works. There are three distinct phases and each one needs different approaches.

First is the application process. You need to do the typical things. That all your information is on LinkedIn, have a good photo, your elevator pitch is clear. There's a great course for this called Rock Your Profile you should watch. I think every LinkedIn employee has send that course, it's really good.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the cost of a bad hire can equal to about 30% of an employee's first year salary. So the first phase of recruiting is geared towards answering the first question, is this person qualified to do the job?

This is where working with a recruiter can help, they usually have lots of practical advice on what to put where. Both recruiters and hiring managers will tell you the same thing. You need to tell a story of who you are becoming. Remember the importance of storytelling?

That story needs to come in practical terms in your resume. What have you done, what do you know?, what experiences have you had and where are you going. Numbers really help here, but anything that can make you stand out from the crowd is great.

The interview is the second part of this process. According to Glassdoor, the average job opening attracts 250 resumes and only 2% of applicants make it past this first phase. That's why networking is really important and a great way to either skip or make it pass this phase. According to LinkedIn, 48% of jobs filled came from direct employee referrals and only about 15% of job hires happen from a job board candidate.

At the phone interview phase, there will be at least five other people still going for that job, but it could be dozens depending on the size of the company. You usually do this with a recruiter who will not necessarily have direct knowledge of the subject matter. Your job is to continue to prove you can do the job, but then also to stand out from the rest. Things like your GPA, Internships, Projects any numbers or experience you have that will set you above other candidates is great. You have only one job...to get to the next interview. Research the job, the interviewer, the company and who you'll be working with (on LinkedIn).

Be patient. The average time it takes to fill a position is about 42 days, and your personal interview process will take an average of 23 days. It can take five to six weeks to get a job offer, so be patient.

Finally, the in-person interview. The reason networking can be so powerful is that it gets you to this point immediately. You can usually skip the application and some of the first interviews and go directly to talking to the decision maker.

At this point, you're talking to one or more decision makers. By this time, the interview will be less technical and more about how you fit in with the company or the team. This is your time to be calm, charming and friendly. The funny thing about this phase is that people tend to prepare for the wrong thing. The interview is much more psychological, so the hiring manager wants to see how you handle stress. They will try to throw a problem or a question that throws you off, just to see how you handle that. Your ability to handle a stressful situation, communicate clearly and be prepared will be really important.

Something that works real well is doing research on the company and the interviewer and having lots of questions for them (there's always a question about if you have any more questions) so have some ready.

There will be a much smaller pool of about 5 or less people depending on the size of the company. LinkedIn has a good set of tools to learn how to go through interview prep.

# About Money

- How much do you expect?
- What you're worth
- Ask someone

> >

In almost every interview, you'll be asked a question like this: "How much do you expect to earn?". You need to be super prepared for that question.

First is to know what you're worth. Sometimes, they'll have a  salary range posted on the job, but this can be rare. You can use the LinkedIn Salary Calculator to find what jobs pay in your area. 

If you know someone, you can ask a question like. 'How much do you think I should ask for this job'. Something non threatening that's not 'How much do you make'.

---

# The three numbers

- Desired rate
- Asking rate
- Walk away rate

> >

This is how much you'd like to make on the job. This number is going to depend on what your research says about how much you should expect to be paid for the job. You're not going to mention this desired rate during your negotiations. 

The Asking rate will be higher than your desired rate and give you some room to maneuver when making negotiations. As a rule of thumb make that around 50% higher than your desired rate. This is how you will answer the question of how much you want to make, but try not to answer that.

The walk away rate is the minimum you're willing to take for the job. It's very important that you have this number before you get there and that you're truly willing to walk away if you don't get it.

---

# When not to talk

- Avoid salary talk
- Nerves of Steel
- Communicate clearly


> >

you should avoid talking about salary unless you're in the offer phase. If you get asked before hand, say something like, "I'm not ready to talk about salary just yet until you're ready to make me an offer. Are you ready to make me an offer now? Now this part is going to take some guts, but practice saying that calmly and totally meaning it. 

If they still want you to give them a number, just ask, "Is there a salary range for this job?" A lot of times the salary range will be posted for the job or at the very least the HR manager will be willing to share that with you. 

If the range seems reasonable according to your numbers, let them know. Same thing if it's too low, let them know. This is a tough topic, but answering this professionaly will set you apart and it's important to show how you'd handle conversations about money with clients and employees. Knowing how to deal with tough situations shows maturity.

---

# Ready for this!

"the salary you are asking for is in the higher range for this position, what do you think justifies that?"

> >

A good response would be that, although, you're just getting started your internships, your background, or other experience shows that you have achieved a higher level of expertise.

---

# Good to Ask

- Bonuses
- Stock Options
- Other Benefits

> >

In addition to salary, you should ask if the company offers bonuses or stock options. Bonuses are often expressed as a percentage of salary over a period of time. So it could be 10-15% of your salary paid once a year. 

Now equity or stock options means that you get a certain amount of stock in the company, and that can be a negotiable amount. Remember that you don't get what you don't ask for. 

Finally, vacations in some companies are often negotiable. Some companies will offer two weeks of paid vacation, but part of your negotiation can be to ask for an extra week or two. Non-negotiable items could include insurance like health, dental, life, or disability, onsite meals, retirement accounts like your 401k, or other items like tuition assistance. 

Now these benefits are important when comparing different companies. You can negotiate your base salary based on how non-negotiable items compare between companies. If one company covers a higher percentage of your health insurance or has a bigger 401k match, you can ask for a higher base salary at a different company.

Here's the thing. Every time I've negotiated my salary, my future bosses have remarked that they were impressed that I did so. Done correctly, it can build respect from your bosses.

# The Offer Letter

- Assurance
- Take time
- Negotiate

> >

Your goal through your interviews is to get to an offer letter. An offer letter means that they want you and only you for this job. Don't take the job unless they're willing to give you a cover letter. The ball is now in your court.

Feel free to accept the offer or not depending on how good it is. It's customary to take some time to think it over, and it's better if you have some time to reflect on the offer before you accept it. Thank the potential employer for the offer, and ask if there is a deadline to respond to it. If they ask how long you need, let them know. A couple of days is normal, but let them know if you're waiting to hear from a few other places, and what that timeline looks like. 

At this time, you may have been applying at a few places and need to compare offers. You can negotiate here but it has to be based on comparisons of what you're being offered somewhere else, or the understanding that you feel that you should be making more.

If you're leaving one job, you can negotiate with your current company to stay based on what the new company is offering you.

Listen to your gut, and make sure that you're happy with an offer before you accept it. Now, this is the last time you can negotiate some aspects of your offer. Remember that whatever you do at this point sets up your future work relationships.

# Being Social

> >

Social networking is the currency of the 21st century. It's important that you consider this as a part of your life. This is an area that I've been working on for the last few years after I joined LinkedIn, so I wanted to share what I've learned and what's been successful.

---

# My Credentials

- 16,890 follows LI
- 208 post/month
- 6,916 Newsletter
- YouTube: 3.81K, Twitter: 7,308

> >

First of all, I have a confession. I'm an introvert and social activities drain me, but I realize the value of having social currency. However, you shouldn't listen to me unless I can show some success.

The network that I focus on the most of course is LinkedIn...of course. I have almost 17k followers on the platform. Before I worked there I had probably less than 1000.

As a matter of fact I just found out in a meeting that as an employee at LinkedIn, I had had the second most posts in the last 30 days with 208 posts per month and that's something I've really been working on.

I just released a newsletter three weeks ago and I now have close to 7000 subscribers.

On some of the othet networks that I focus less on, I have about 4000 subscribers on YouTube and about 7000 on Twitter.

# Why Social?

- Opportunities
- Leadership
- Results

> >

Remember when I mentioned that the number one way that people got jobs is through their connections? Social networking will bring opportunities to you instead of you having to look for them.

The more you present, the more of an authority you'll become. You'll receive more opportunities than other and that will translate to more success. People will view you as a connector and an expert in the field quicker.

The way I got to write a book was because of a connection I had in the publishing industry. Social delivers results. For example instructors that share have a 44% increase in followers and 4.4 times more learners watching their courses. The more you participate the more value it will have. <1 % of members are power createors, but create 40% of all downstream sessions.

---

# How to Succeed

- Develop a plan
- Work the plan
- Continue the plan

> >

The first way to succeed in social is to develop what is achievable for you. Examine your strengths here. I plan a post twice a day, write my newsletter on Tuesday Nights and create one or two videos on Saturdays. I'm planning on a Live Stream once a week, one of which is a product launch. That's my current plan, but it didn't start out like that.


I have a full time job, which takes a lot of time, so my plan started with a simple goal. Could I post once a day? That would get me used to the cadence of doing something regularly. I learned about tools like Publer and Switchy that would help me organize and streamline posting. Once I was comfortable with that, I moved on to trying out livestreams. That got me comfortable with the software like Streamyard. That also got me to learn how to multi-broadcast. Once I mastered that, I moved onto articles, which led to newsletters and my future weekly streams.

The important thing is that you focus on the plan, not the results at first. Your job is to get comfortable being regular. The community will grow, but you have to give it time.

# Getting Followers

- Start by following
- High Value Targets
- Deliver Value

> >

How do you get followers? You can do that by starting to follow others and participating in conversations. Making connections on LinkedIn will automatically create a two way relationship and have people follow you. Comments on social platforms, participating on the netwok will expand your network.

My second piece of advice is to always target higher value followers. Don't just follow anyone, but follow and engage with people who engage with your content. If someone makes a comment on a post, I send them a connection request. The most valuable target is those who share your content. Because sharing multiplies your audience by theirs.

The second value target is commenters. Meaningful comments add value to your conversations and drive engagement by encouraging more conversations.

The third are likes, or other emotions. It's easy to hit a like, but those viewers are more engaged than lurkers.

The most important thing to be successful in Social Media is to focus on delivering value for your audience. Thats why it's not enough to reshare, but to add your own take and perspective on what you publish. If you do this, then your social network will grow organically.
