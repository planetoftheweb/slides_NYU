Working with a real project like this is a lot of fun, but I bet you're probably wondering what else you could do with this technology.

You can spend a lot of time inside the documentation for the Github GraphQL Explorer: https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/overview/explorer. It's well documented and a great place to explore what else you could add to this app.

You should also check out the documentation for the regular version of [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/).

We have lot of content on GraphQL as well as React, so make sure you do a search in the library for some additional content.

Finally, if you want to know what I'm up to, check out raybo.org my blog, where you can follow me or search for my name Ray Villalobos and follow me on LinkedIn.
