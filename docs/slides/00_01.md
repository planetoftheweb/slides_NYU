# React

> >

Here's two reasons why If I had to learn only one JavaScript framework...it would be React. First, The speed at which it's dominated the industry is amazing...if I was looking for a job as a front end or full stack developer, chances are it's on the list of preferred skills. But the second reason is more important, it's a lot of fun to code in...React makes things that are annoying, like managing the virtual DOM...trivial.

Hey there, this is Ray Villalobos, Senior Staff Instructor at LinkedIn and I created this course as a quick introduction to React that will teach you how it works in a practical way. I'm assuming you know the basics of html, css and javascript and that's about it.

We're going to build a simple application that will get you some experience with React and show you why you should spend the time to learn it, so if you're ready to build an interactive project...let's get started.
